================================================


1. Introduction                              *ruby-doc-introduction*

When your cursor is on something you would look up on apidock, type:

- RB for Ruby
- RS for RSpec
- RR for Rails

and the plugin will open a new tab in your browser (or a new instance of the
browser) to the related docs.

                                               *:RubyDoc* *:RspecDoc* *:RailsDoc*

The plugin adds three command-line commands for searching arbitrary stuff.
Example:

>
   :RubyDoc each

2. Configuration                                  *ruby-doc-configuration*

By default, the plugin uses the xdg-open command to look up the docs but you
can easily change the command. For example, if you are OSX you would like to
change it:

                                                      *g:ruby_doc_command*  >
    let g:ruby_doc_command='open'

Furthermore, you can choose your own mapping in the following way:

   *g:ruby_doc_ruby* *g:ruby_doc_rspec_mapping* *g:ruby_doc_rails_mapping*  >

   let g:ruby_doc_ruby_mapping='KK'
